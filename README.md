# Mini Project â€“ Step 1: TCP Echo Test

This is the first step of the **Mini Project**.  
It demonstrates a basic **TCP echo test** between two agents:

- **Agent B (server)**: Listens on port `4401` and echoes back whatever it receives.
- **Agent A (client)**: Sends JSON probe packets, receives echoes, and measures **round-trip time (RTT)**.

---

##  How It Works
1. Agent A sends a JSON probe every 0.5 seconds:
   ```json
   {
     "seq": 0,
     "t_send_ns": 1234567890
   }
   ```
2. Agent B echoes back the same JSON.
3. Agent A measures **RTT (latency)**:
   ```
   RTT = time_received - t_send_ns
   ```
4. Results are printed in the terminal.

##  How to Run

### Start Agent B (Echo Server)
```bash
python agent_b_echo.py
```

Expected output:
```
[Agent B] Echo server listening on 0.0.0.0:4401
[Agent B] Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 54321)
```

---

### Start Agent A (Client)
```bash
python agent_a_client.py
```

Expected output:
```
[Agent A] Connected to Agent B 127.0.0.1:4401
[Agent A] Seq=0 RTT=0.600 ms
[Agent A] Seq=1 RTT=0.420 ms
[Agent A] Seq=2 RTT=0.515 ms
...
```

##  What We Achieved
- Established a persistent **TCP connection** between Agent A and Agent B.
- Implemented a simple **echo server**.
- Measured **RTT (latency)** for each probe.

Next step will be to **aggregate RTTs per minute** and prepare for MQTT publishing.
